# Haunts

This is a rouge continuation of the Haunts project that was a Kickstarted project that never fully got released. While it's unfortunate, it's an interesting piece of Go history because it would have been the first commercially sold game written in Go. As a backer of the Kickstarter, I've never regretted my contribution, as my main motivation was knowing the game was written in Go, and that the source code was going to be available.

## What to expect

Probably not much, this is being done in my free time, but I hope to get the project back into a workable state. The hope is that if that's achieved, the game can finally be finished. That said, it may not happen (by me at least) as I'm only able to work on this in the little free time I have. At some point, if I'm able to achieve a working build, I'll attempt to push the changes back to MobRulesGames. However, I'm not sure what the interest level from them is to continue development on a mostly dead project.

## Why now

I think that with the advances in Go tooling and larger community, it will be easier to keep the project in a workable state as well as finding new interested developers in working on the project. I'm better equipped to work on the project now as I've been using Go professionally for the last three years.
